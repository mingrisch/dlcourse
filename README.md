# Deep learning course

I am participating in the deep learning MOOC from http://fast.ai. Usually late at night, and hence in small batches. I use the present markdown file for log-keeping and managing to-do lists, in order to be independent of the computer I am working on.

# Infrastructure and workflow

For training CNNs, I will use an AWS p2.large instance. Setting things up and running will be done on a much cheaper t2.large instance. To synchronize the machines, I will use the present github repository.

# Week 1

In week one, we are expected to set up an AWS p2.large instance and get keras on top of theano up and running. We use this instance to retrain a VGG 16 model to discriminate between cats and dogs. 

As a homework, we have to participate in the cats vs dogs redux challenge on http://kaggle.com, using a fine-tuned VGG16 model.

## To do

A general to-do list is managed here, finer details will be handled in a jupyter notebook.

- [] get p2.large machine up and running
- [] get competition data handling script up and running (inside a notebook?)
- [] Train and finetune on p2.large instance!
- [] prepare kaggle submission
